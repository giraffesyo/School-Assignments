1. Create code that performs histogram matching over a database (30   pts):
    - User   input:   query   image   and   comparison   method
    - Program output: a file with the scores and name of the image, orderer by best to worst
score.

    You   can   follow   the   next   tutorial: http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/histograms/histogram_comparison/histogram_comparison.html

2.  Create code that computes the visual odometry of a user selected ROI (region of interest) using   an   implementation   of   Lukas   Kanade   Algorithm.

    Estimate the x (horizontal axis) and y (depth) displacement and draw in a 2D map, the estimates   results   in   a   continuous   path.

    Use   the   following   image   sequence: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1kocsphlAgvYnlOdE9DUTZWV3c
