Numerical Methods
Homework 1

Create a Matlab program that solves a system of equations using Gauss elimination.

- The code should ask for a matrix containing the equations and a vector containig all the constants.

- 50% for creating a code that does Forward elimination

- 30% for solving the systems using Forward and Backward elimination

- 30% (Extra 10%) Solves the inverse of a matrix(Should ask only for the matrix to invert)

- The steps should be shown as it solves the system.

- You cannot use Matlab functions that simply solve the system

- All the code has to be commented

- The code should be able to receive any kind of matrix and have to check for size in order to proceed
