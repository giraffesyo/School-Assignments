Due: **9/28/2015**

1. This assignment asks you to write 2 interactive programs that will give you experience in using the `if` statement.  The input for both programs will come from the keyboard.

2. The first program requires the use of nested `if` statements.  Write a program that prompts the user as follows:
  >Enter a single letter, and I will tell you what the corresponding digit is on the telephone keypad.

  Suppose the user enters the letter `R`. Your program will output:
  >The digit 7 corresponds to the letter R on the telephone keypad.

  If the user enters a character that is not a letter on the telephone keypad, for example `&`, output the following:
  >There is no digit on the telephone keypad that corresponds to &.

  Valid letters on a telephone keyboard include A through P and R through Y.
  **Z, Q, and all other characters on the computer keyboard should be considered invalid.**
  The user of the program should be able to enter both **lowercase** and **uppercase letters**.
  The program output that you turn in should show how your program handles the following characters: `C`,`c`,`Q`,`N`,`n`,`&`. You will have to run your program 6 times.

3. The second program requires you to write a program as indicated in Programming Problem #10 on page 240 in your textbook.
  You are only asked to write a program to find the median of 3 numbers.  Please use the following sets of data to test your program:

  Data set 1: `123.67`  `88.22` `555.11`

  Data set 2: `345.45`  `567.23` `777.44`

  Data set 3: `879.13`  `445.97` `675.32`

  You will need to run your program 3 times.

4. Turn in the following:
  - A printed copy of your programs
  - A printed copy of the output produced by the programs using the test data given in paragraphs 2 and 3.
  - The USB device containing your programs.
