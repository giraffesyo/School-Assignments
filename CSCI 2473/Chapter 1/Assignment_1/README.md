Assignment 1
--
Assignment 1 from CSCI 2473 was merely an introduction assignment where we were instructed to copy some code from a paper and compile it, while purposefully causing syntax errors to introduce us to compiler errors. While this code was not graded, I have included it in this repository for completeness.
