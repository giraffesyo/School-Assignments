Programming Assignment  
Chapter 11A - Single Dimension Arrays  
Due:  11/16/2015

1. Place the following values in a file. Use this file as an input to your program.
  `62 8 25 7 90 82 22 46 15 54`
2. Write a program that performs the following:
  1. Read 10 integers from the input file into a 10 position array.
  2. Output the 10 integers on the same line from the array.
  3. Output the 4th integer in the array.
  4. Computer and output the sum and average of the last 6 integers in the array.
  5. Find and output the smallest integer in the array.
  6. Find and output the largest integer in the array.
  7. Output the first 4 integers in the array on the same line in reverse order.
  8. Sort the integers in the array. You may want to use the function SelSort in the file named cch11SelSort.cpp
  9. Output the 10 integers on the same line from the array to confirm that the sort took place correctly.
3. All 10 integers must be read into the array before any other processing can be accomplished. That is, steps 1.2 through 1.9 cannot be performed during the reading of the integers. The purpose of this exercise is to practice manipulating a single dimension array.
4. Write all output to a file.
5. Turn in:
  - a printed copy of your program
  - a printed copy of the output file produced by this program
  - a USB device containing your program
