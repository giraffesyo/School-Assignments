###Assignment_2A

Problem 1 excerpted from page 88:

Write a program that prints out your course schedule for a single week. Here's an example of the output for one day:

```
Monday  9:00  Computer Science  101
Monday  11:00 Physics 201
Monday  2:00  Dance 153
```
Use named string constants wherever possible to avoid retyping any words or numbers.
Be sure to include appropriate comments in your code, choose meaningful indentifiers, and use indentation as we do with the programs in this chapter.
