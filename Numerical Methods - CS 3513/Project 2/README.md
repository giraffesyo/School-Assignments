The assignment information for this project is located in the [project pdf](./Project2.pdf). This PDF was given by the professor. While the assignment pdf does note that we need to make a report, this requirement was removed by the professor after he assigned the project.

The file [satuSignal.mat](./satuSignal.mat) was also provided by the professor.

This project was a team collaboration between Jos√© Luna, Vincent Vargas, [Joshua McMahan](https://github.com/JoshMcMahan), and myself.
