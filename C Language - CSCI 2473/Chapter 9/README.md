**Programming Assignment**  
**Chapter 9**

1. Write an interactive **menu driven** program that allows the user to obtain specified measurements of several geometric figures. A loop will be used to allow the user to continue to request computations as long as he/she wants and stops when the user wants to stop.
2. The program should computer the following:
  1. The area of a square: AREA = SIDE X SIDE
  2. The area of a rectangle: AREA = LENGTH X WIDTH
  3. The hypotenuse of a right triangle: HYPOTENUSE = SQRT ( SIDE1 X SIDE 1 + SIDE2 X SIDE 2)
  4. The area of a right triangle: AREA = SIDE1 X SIDE 2 / 2
  5. The area of an isosceles triangle: AREA = HEIGHT X BASE / 2
  6. The circumference of a circle: CIRCUMFERENCE = 2 X RADIUS X Pi
  7. The area of a circle: RADIUS X RADIUS X Pi
  8. The volume of a sphere: VOLUME = 4 X PI X RADIUS X RADIUS X RADIUS / 3
3. Each of the computations above must be performed in separate **value returning** functions. They will be called when needed to provide the user with the requested information. These functions will **not** contain any input or output statements.
4. All numeric values used in this program should be of type **double**. Output all answers using 2 decimal positions. Use 3.1416 for Pi.
5. Use the following data to test your program. Test all 8 options.
  1. Side = 10.5
  2. Length = 15.5 Width = 20.5
  3. Side1 = 30.5 Side2 = 35.5
  4. Side1 = 40.5 Side2 = 45.5
  5. Height = 50.5 Base = 55.5
  6. Radius = 60.5
  7. Radius = 65.5
  8. Radius = 5.5
6. Display the answers on the screen. Also write the answers to a file. Do not write the menu to the output file. Print the file and turn it in with your program.
7. Turn in:
  - a printed copy of your program
  - a USB device containing your program
  - a program structure chart of your program
  - a printed copy of your output file
