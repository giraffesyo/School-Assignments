Course Objectives

Have you ever wondered how to build a computer from the ground up from logic gates? I mean, imagine that you know how to build a NAND gate out of tinker toys. What would it take to build a fully functioning processor from a few thousand of these in your basement? Conceptually, that’s what we’re going to be learning in this class! In this class you will be designing a complete processor down to the logic gate level. Beyond that, we will see how high-level languages such as C can be made to run on a computer through the magic of compilation.

Modern computers are built up in layers of abstraction, and this class will follow those levels, starting with the digital logic layer (just above transistors), and going through ALU, CPU, and memory design. Once we have established how a computer is physically put together, we will also look at assembly language, and see how to translate higher-level constructs such as for loops, if statements, and function calls, into the linear structure of assembly. By the end of the class, you should have a deep understanding of how computers work internally, some basic competence in writing MIPS assembly code, and some understanding of how compiled languages get executed on computers. Class topics will include the following:

- Digital logic.
- Parts of a computer and their basic organization.
- ALU Design.
- Basic CPU design and control Flow.
- Number formats.
- Instruction Sets (we will look particularly at MIPS).
- Assembly language, and how to translate structured constructs to it.
- The compilation process which links higher-level languages to assembly and machine code.
