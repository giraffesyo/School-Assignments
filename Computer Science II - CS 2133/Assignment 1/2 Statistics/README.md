#Statistics (30 points)

Write a program called `Average.java` that prompts a user to enter a number, and allows the user to continue to enter numbers until she responds with a negative number. At that point, the program should print out how many numbers the user entered (not including the negative one), and the average of those numbers.

Note: This program will use a `Scanner` object such as you learned about in CS I. This is the only occasion in this class that you are likely to use a `Scanner` object for user interaction. You will be using command-line arguments or GUI widgets in every other program you write (or, sometimes, not interacting with a user at all).

```sh
$ java Average
Enter a series of numbers. Enter a negative number to quit.
1
2
4.5
3
5
-1
You entered 5 numbers averaging 3.1.
```
