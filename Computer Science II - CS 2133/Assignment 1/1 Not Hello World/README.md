# Not Hello World (10 points)

This problem will ensure that your programming environment is functional and you remember how to compile a simple Java class. Write a program called Greeting.java that prints out a greeting. It can say anything you like, except for “Hello, world!”

```sh
$ java Greeting
Bonjour, tout le monde!
```
