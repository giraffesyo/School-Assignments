#Message in a Bottle (20 points)

Create a `MessageFrame` class extending `JFrame` and a MessagePanel class extending `JPanel`. Add
the panel to the frame. The frame should be titled “Message in a Bottle” and should end the
program when the close box is clicked. In the panel, draw a bottle shape using some combination of
Graphics object methods like `drawLine`, `drawPolygon`, `drawPolyline`, `drawRoundRect` and `drawArc`
(look up the Graphics object in the Java API for details). Make the bottle as attractive as you can,
although you won’t be graded on artistic merit. In the center of the bottle shape, add a message
string. Create a `Message` class with a main method that instantiates the `MessageFrame` and gets
the ball rolling.
