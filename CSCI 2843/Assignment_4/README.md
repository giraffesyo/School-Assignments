**Programming Assignment #4**  

1. This assignment asks you to add some code to the program you produced for programming assignment #3. Do not change the code in assignment #3, simply add to it as follows:
  - Overload the `>>` operator to allow for reading a new name and new balance from the keyboard and use the data to update the object's data members.
  - Overload the `<<` operator to display the Name, Balance, and Interest Rate of an object on the screen with proper labels.
  - Overload the `+=` operator to allow an increase to a saver's balance. Use a voice member function. The function call will have the following syntax: `Saver1 += 10000;`
  - Overload the `-=` operator to allow a decrease to a saver's balance. Use a void member function. The function call will have the following syntax `Saver1 -= 700;`
  - Create a 4th object and use it to test all the member functions and overloaded operator functions.
2. Turn in:
  - a printed copy of the 3 source files
  - a printed copy of the output produced by the program
  - a USB device containing the header file and the 2 source (.cpp) files
  - a list of the tasks your program performs
